## Objective
The aim of the Pizza Sales Dashboard project is to leverage SQL for data extraction and transformation, along with Power BI for visualization, to analyze and present actionable insights from a fictional pizza restaurant chain's sales data. The objective is to optimize operations, enhance sales, and improve customer satisfaction by creating a visually appealing and informative dashboard that highlights key performance metrics, sales trends, customer segmentation, and other relevant insights.
## Process Involved
### 1.  Data Importing and Cleaning using Power Query Tool
### 2.  Data Processing using Dax Functionalities in Power Bi and Customisation according to our needs
### 3.  Data Analysis
Once the data is prepared, various SQL queries are written to perform in-depth data analysis. This may include:
Identifying top-selling pizza flavors.
Analyzing sales trends over time.
 Evaluating customer demographics and preferences.
 Calculating average order values.
Assessing the performance of individual restaurant locations.
  ###  4. Power BI Visualization
 Power BI is used to create interactive and informative visualizations that showcase the insights gained from the data analysis. The visualizations may include:
